A pragmatic engineer building robust firmware and intuitive device UIs. I focus on embedded systems (ESP32), modern C++ architecture, and testable UI/tooling for constrained hardware.

## Summary
I design and implement embedded firmware and companion tooling with an emphasis on reliability, maintainability, and developer ergonomics. My projects blend low-level systems programming with practical user interfaces for devices such as e‑paper displays.

## Areas of Focus
- Modern C++ for embedded systems and improving testability
- ESP32 / Arduino framework, FreeRTOS
- E-paper UIs (GxEPD, Adafruit GFX)
- Rust (exploration), Python, TypeScript for tooling and automation
- Mentoring, open-source contribution, and design-driven firmware

## Technical Skills
- Languages: C, C++, Python, TypeScript, Rust (learning)
- Embedded: ESP32, FreeRTOS, Arduino
- Libraries: GxEPD, Adafruit GFX, RTClib
- Tools: Git, VS Code, CMake, CI, basic RTOS patterns
- Design: Figma, UX for constrained displays

## Selected Projects
- ESP32-Virtualpet — Virtual pet platform with persistent state and responsive graphics
