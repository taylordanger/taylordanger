# Taylor Danger — Embedded Systems Engineer

I design firmware and small-screen device UIs that feel polished and reliable. I focus on testable architecture, reproducible tooling, and UX that respects constrained hardware.

• Embedded systems (ESP32) • Modern C++ • e‑paper displays • Testable UI tooling

---

## Quick facts

- Role: Embedded Systems Engineer
- Location: Remote / Hybrid
- Availability: Open to collaboration & freelance

---

## Skills & tools

- Languages: C, C++ (modern), Python, TypeScript
- Embedded: ESP32, FreeRTOS, Arduino framework
- Displays & UI: GxEPD, Adafruit GFX, e‑paper UX patterns
- Tooling: CMake, Git, CI, automated asset generation

Proficiency: C/C++ · Embedded systems · Python/tooling · Rust (learning)

---

## Selected projects

- ESP32-Virtualpet — Virtual pet on ESP32: persistent state, efficient render loops, playful UX patterns.
  - https://github.com/taylordanger/ESP32-Virtualpet

- GxEPD-Multiple-Epaper-Screen-Example — Multi-screen patterns and transitions for e‑paper devices.
  - https://github.com/taylordanger/GxEPD-Multiple-Epaper-Screen-Example

- Open-source contributions — small, high-impact PRs to improve e‑paper and embedded tooling reliability.

---

## How I work

- Build small, testable abstractions so UI logic can run on desktop and on-device.
- Prefer incremental changes, reproducible builds, and automated asset generation.
- Treat UX for constrained devices as a first-class engineering problem.

## Dev demo (simulated)

Example simulated terminal output from a local device simulator:

```
$ ./tools/sim --display=212x104 --profile=eink
[  OK  ] init: display driver GxEPD2
[  OK  ] load: assets (18 items)
[ INFO ] UI: home screen ready
[ INFO ] input: map keys -> {A:left, B:select, C:right}
[ READY] Simulation listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
> press [A] [B] [C] to simulate button events
```

If you'd like, I can:

- Add badges (build/coverage) and a resume link
- Create a short contributor guide or a pinned projects section
- Tweak tone/length for hiring vs. open-source audiences

Thanks — tell me what style you'd prefer (compact, friendly, or technical) and I'll iterate.
