A pragmatic engineer crafting robust firmware and thoughtful device UIs. I design testable embedded systems and companion tooling that make hardware feel polished and dependable.

---

## What I build
- Reliable firmware for constrained devices (ESP32, FreeRTOS).
- Intuitive UIs for e‑paper and low-power displays.
- Tooling and companion apps to streamline development and testing.

## Quick snapshot
- Languages: C, C++, Python, TypeScript, Rust (learning)  
- Embedded: ESP32, Arduino framework, FreeRTOS  
- Libraries & tooling: GxEPD, Adafruit GFX, RTClib, CMake, Git, VS Code

## Featured projects
### ESP32-Virtualpet
A lightweight virtual pet platform for ESP32 — persistent state, responsive drawing, and playful UX patterns.

### GxEPD-Multiple-Epaper-Screen-Example
Patterns for managing multiple e‑paper screens and transitions across constrained displays. Useful reference for multi-screen embedded UIs.

### Open Source Contributions
A collection of PRs, bug fixes, and improvements across embedded and UI libraries. My focus is pragmatic fixes that make projects easier to use and maintain.

## How I approach problems
- Start with strong abstractions so device logic is testable on desktop.
- Prefer small, well-scoped APIs that are easy to mock and iterate.
- Invest in reproducible tooling and CI for firmware builds and asset generation.

## Speaking & mentorship
I run local workshops and mentor early-career engineers on embedded systems and practical testing strategies. I enjoy translating low-level constraints into elegant UX.

## Small, optional extras (suggestions)
- Add the GitHub activity and top-langs widgets if you want dynamic profile cards.  
  Example:
  - `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=taylordanger&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight`
  - `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=taylordanger&layout=compact&theme=tokyonight`
- Consider a compact header image (local asset) or a single portrait to make the profile friendlier.
- Replace external badge URLs with local images if you prefer privacy / no external calls.

Short bio (one line)
> Embedded systems engineer focused on ESP32 and e‑paper UIs — building reliable, testable firmware with modern C++.

If you want, I can:
- Trim this to a single-screen profile for GitHub with widgets and a portrait.
- Replace the shields with a minimal set or with local badge images.
- Commit the file to your repo (I can provide the exact commit diff or the git commands).
