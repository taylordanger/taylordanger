## Featured projects
| Project | What & Why |
|---|---|
| [ESP32-Virtualpet](https://github.com/taylordanger/ESP32-Virtualpet) | Virtual pet platform on ESP32 — real-time graphics, persistent state, playful UX patterns. Great for UI + RTOS patterns. |
| [GxEPD-Multiple-Epaper-Screen-Example](https://github.com/taylordanger/GxEPD-Multiple-Epaper-Screen-Example) | Patterns for managing multiple e‑paper screens and transitions on constrained devices. Useful reference for multi-screen firmware. |
| Open source contributions | Practical PRs and fixes that increase library usability for e‑paper and embedded toolchains. |

---

## How I work (short)
- Design small, testable abstractions so UI logic can run efficiently on desktop and embedded targets.
- Prefer incremental, test-first changes and reproducible tooling for builds and assets.
- Value pragmatic code: readable, reviewable, and easy to maintain.

## Dev terminal: device simulator boot (flavor)
```bash
$ ./simulator --display=212x104 --profile=eink
[  OK  ] init: display driver GxEPD2
[  OK  ] load: assets (18 images)
[ INFO ] UI: home screen ready
[ INFO ] input: map keys -> {A:left, B:select, C:right}
[ READY] Simulation listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
> press [A] [B] [C] to simulate button events

If you want, I can:
- Trim this to a single-screen profile for GitHub with widgets and a portrait.
- Replace the shields with a minimal set or with local badge images.
- Commit the file to your repo (I can provide the exact commit diff or the git commands).
